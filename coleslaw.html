    <p>With some cabbage (or coleslaw mix) and a few basic ingredients, this will be a go-to side dish for almost any occasion. This is the best coleslaw recipe, perfect for parties and summer potlucks and it is so simple to make.</p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>

    <ul>
        <li>BASE: We use a mixture of regular green cabbage, a bit of red (or purple) cabbage, and shredded carrots. You can swap this out for a bag of coleslaw mix but don’t limit it to cabbage try any “slaw” that your store carries.</li>

        <li>DRESSING:  Homemade coleslaw is so good because of the zesty creamy dressing. If you’re short on time (or ingredients) store-bought dressing can be used, you’ll want something tangy and sweet.</li>
    </ul>
    
<h3>Directions</h3>

<ul>
    <li>Shred Cabbage: Finely shred cabbage using a mandoline, a food processor, or make thin slices with a knife. For the carrots, I grate them on the larger side of a box grater.</li>

    <li>Prep Dressing: Whisk the dressing ingredients in a large bowl</li>

    <li>Combine & Chill: Add the cabbage and carrots to the dressing and stir to combine. Refrigerate for at least one hour.</li>


</ul>
